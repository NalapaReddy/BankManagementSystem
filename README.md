-----------------------
Bank Management System — Java OOP Project
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming methodology that organizes software design around data and objects rather than functions and logic. Your project is a strong demonstration of the four major OOP principles:

1. Abstraction

Abstraction hides complex internal logic and exposes only necessary features to the user.
In this project, BankAccount is an abstract class representing common properties of accounts while hiding internal logic of transactions.

2. Encapsulation

Encapsulation bundles data and methods inside classes and restricts direct access using access modifiers.
Your project uses private, protected, and getters to ensure secure handling of account data.

3. Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties of another.
SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount inherit from BankAccount, sharing common attributes while implementing their own behaviors.

4. Polymorphism

Polymorphism enables methods to behave differently based on the object type.
Both account types override deposit() and withdraw() methods, providing account-specific implementations.

OOP helps make your code modular, reusable, scalable, and easier to maintain.

=> Input Validation

Prevents negative deposits/withdrawals

Displays meaningful error messages

=>Technologies Used

Language: Java
